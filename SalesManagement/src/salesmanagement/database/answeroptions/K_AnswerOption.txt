This is a good technique for handling an objection--agreeing first (partially) and then answering the objection.  A little agreement or complimentary remark acknowledging the prospect's statement will often open the prospect's mind and soften the blow of your rebuttal.  In this case, however, rebuttal would be premature.  Better find out the exact problem before you try to answer.

Before handling an objection, it's important to find out what the exact objection is.  Is price a stall or her bonafide reason for changing suppliers?  Is it the competitor's cheaper price that's attractive or does the problem exist with SOS's own salespeople--and their inability to sell a high-priced line?  There could be many problems so before you answer the objection, do some probing and find out what the real one is.

This is a good point but a bad time to remind her about it.  Throw it in later perhaps, but don't rely on past favor too heavily.  After all, you and your company have also profited from the relationship with SOS.

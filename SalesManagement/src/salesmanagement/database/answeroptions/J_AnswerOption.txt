This isn't much of a close.  It's weak and may encourage negative comments or objections.

This is often called the "alternative-choice" close. Simply give her a choice of two things relating to the order.  If she chooses either one, it indicates she's mentally purchased the kits (or is seriously thinking about an order) and you're on your way.  The idea is to give her a choice of two items (colors, sizes, models, delivery dates, etc.) but not "yes" or "no."

Here you're giving her a choice of "yes" or "no" which is somewhat dangerous.  If she says "yes," fine, but a "no" can be deadly.  Since you have a fifty percent action--like signing the order, giving you a purchase order number, supplying credit reference, etc. the important thing is to ask.

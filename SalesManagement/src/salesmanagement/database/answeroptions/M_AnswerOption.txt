Even though you know that your offer is the best one, asking the buyer to cancel a signed contract is wrong. Not only is such an action unethical, it would cost you the customer's business in the future.

Here, you are acting in the best interest of your company, your customer, and yourself. By not asking your client to cancel her contract and sign your contract, you have maintained the client's trust. Asking her to void the contract, on the other hand, would have been highly unethical. However, it is important that you take the time to explain to your client the proposal which you were prepared to present. That way, perhaps your client will keep your company in mind the next time the firm needs your products. Then, both her company and your company can benefit.

By saying nothing about the signed contract, you are acting in a professional manner. You are following the rules and employing conventional behaviour.

Calling back in two months at the request of Mr. Newland is the path of least resistance—the easy way out.  While it may get you the order in the long run, it can also set up many obstacles.  A lot of things can occur in two months: a competitor could get in to see Mr. Newland; Aces' business could fall off; money may be tight, etc.  By waiting (without trying for an immediate order) you are encouraging problems.

There's nothing better than a firm purchase order in hand.  Perhaps some good old-fashioned persistence would have done the job; after all, Mr. Newland said he liked the equipment, admitted that it would solve his problem, and indicated that he would buy.  Why not now?  If you can't get an immediate order, perhaps you can get one for delivery in thirty days ("Let's not wait until the last minute") or in sixty days.  At minimum, a stronger verbal commitment would help—to pin him down, to obligate him, and to bring him closer to that actual order.

If you can't get the order now, a good alternative would be to telephone.  A personal call takes time, is expensive and can't accomplish more than a phone call (especially when your objective is to get a "go ahead").  Why wait the full two months?  You'll probably need some time for delivery.  Besides, it's a good way to remind him that you're on your toes—anticipating problems and taking care of his needs.

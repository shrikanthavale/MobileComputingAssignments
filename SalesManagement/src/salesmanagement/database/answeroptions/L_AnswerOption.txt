This is a weak question because it asks for a "yes" or "no" answer--no more.  Remember, you wanted information and a "yes" or "no" is the bare minimum.

This is a good question.  It's direct, well-aimed, and most importantly, it forces the prospect to talk about a specific problem.  An open-ended question (one that can't be answered by "yes" or "no") often provides additional information--things you didn't ask for--and that is a plus.

This question is adequate, but lacking in some aspects.  It's open-ended and that's good--it'll encourage the prospect to talk.  However, it's too loose, too general.  It won't easily trigger the prospect to give you the information you seek.  And you do want to make it easy for him.

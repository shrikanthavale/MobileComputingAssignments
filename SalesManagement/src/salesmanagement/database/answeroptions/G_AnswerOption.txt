This attention-getter is reasonably good because it points out a benefit to the buyer.  Under most circumstances it would capture his attention.  Further, the use of your product in the opener may also arouse her curiosity since she probably doesn't know what it is.  The weak spot here is "time and money."  Basically, time and money are benefits—but very general in nature.   "Time and money" is also a time-worn  cliché which many sophisticated buyers have heard so often they automatically put up their guard when they hear it again

This attention-getter may do more harm than good.  First of all it sounds a little humbling to "beg" for a few minutes of time.  If your product is good (and it is!) then you deserve the time to tell your complete story.  It's up to you to motivate the prospect sufficiently so she wants to hear it.  "To talk about shelving" implies a friendly discussion and offers no benefit or motivation.  This type of opener may encourage prospects to say "I'm too busy right now.

Curiosity and benefit are compelling attention-getters and this opener combines both.  It offers a benefit but doesn't say how it can be gained, thus arousing curiosity.  In addition, it asks a question—another useful device for getting attention.  A question usually demands an answer and when the prospect does respond he forfeits her divided attention.

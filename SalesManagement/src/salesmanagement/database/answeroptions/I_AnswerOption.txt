This method is not as good as "C", but it is a good second choice.  Make her feel important, build up her ego by taking the time (if she can afford it) to give her a meaningful message.  Don't get trapped into telling her everything.  They can't do the buying.  Whet her appetite and get her on your team.

We're afraid that under normal circumstances this answer will provoke the typical response: "We don't need any."  You can be rest assured that the hurried, often protective switchboard person will try to get rid of salespeople.  Since she knows what "dictaphones" are you are giving her a great opportunity for a negative reaction.

This is the best answer because it's direct and to the point.  You really  haven't told her what the product is so it's difficult for her to say the company "doesn't need any."  Secondly, you have given her some of the benefits; hopefully she won't want to take the responsibility for her company missing out on them.  Thirdly, you've repeated your request for her to direct you to the purchasing agent (or reasonable facsimile).

Gillespie seems to be wavering when he says, "I'd like to think this over, however."  His stall or objection is certainly weak—especially when preceded by a commitment that your product will solve his problem.  If you accept his excuse, you could be in trouble.  He could have a valid reason for delaying, but if you don't find out what it is now, you may never have an opportunity to answer it.  Evidently there's something on his mind and it behooves you to find out what it is.

Ignoring his "stall" (since it was expressed weakly) is a good technique in some selling situations.  It's especially good when the objection or stall is a trivial one, or not expressed with conviction.  You don't want to blow it up, or make it seem important by discussing it.  In this case there may be something more serious on his mind.  It's a good secondary technique, however, so you should be rewarded for using it.

This is a good technique.  Let him tell you what's holding him back.  Being an effective salesman requires lots of detective work.  If you ask tactfully, he's apt to tell you what you have to do in order to sell him!  "Thinking it over" is not important—the key is to find out exactly what he has got to think about.

After a two-hour drive to see an important new prospect, you stop at a local coffee shot for a bite to eat. As you are looking over your presentation charts, the coffee spills on about half a dozen of them. You don’t have substitute presentation charts with you. What should you do?

A.	Phone the prospect and say that you’d like to make another appointment. Say that something came up.
B.	Go ahead and keep the appointment. At the start of your presentation, tell the prospect about the coffee spill and apologize for it.
C.	Go ahead with your presentation. But don’t make excuses. The coffee stains are barely noticeable if you’re not on the lookout for them.

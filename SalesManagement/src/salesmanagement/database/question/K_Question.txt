As you drive up into the parking lot of one of your best distributors of your home building supplies, you recall how only two years ago they purchased the largest opening order you ever sold. Last year their sales doubled and this year you hope to sell them over $100,000 worth. 
	
	As you wait, the receptionist informs you that since your last visit your buyer, John Smalley, was fired and another buyer was transferred in to take his place. John and you had become reasonably good friends over the past two years and you hated to see him go. 

	As you enter the new buyer’s office, she asks you to have a seat and then says: “I’ve got some bad news for you. I’m considering switching suppliers. Your prices are too high.”

Under the circumstances the best way to react to this objection would be:

A.	“It’s certainly a good idea to compare prices, because price is always an important consideration. When you add up all the benefits we offer, however, I think you’ll find that our prices - - over the long haul - - are actually lower than the competition’s.”
B.	“Would you mind telling me exactly why you’re considering this move?”
C.	“Gee, I’m really surprised at this move. After all, we were the ones who originally got you interested in handling home building supplies. Our service had been good, and most importantly, you’ve derived excellent profits from our line.”

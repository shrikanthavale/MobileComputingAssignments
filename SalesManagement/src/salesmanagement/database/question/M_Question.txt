You have been working for two months onan industrial account to obtain a firm commitment for a $185,000 computer system. Over the past three years, this particular firm has purchased $575,000 from your company. If you can land the order today, you will become eligible for a quarterly commission bonus of $2,500. To meet your competitor’s lower prices, your manager decides to give you special authorization to offer your client a $9,000 package consisting of free software, specialized operation training, and extended-service contractterms. Similar incentives have been offered on special occasions in the past. All customers are eligible for the package. You feel this sweetened offer will bring you below your competitor’s rock-bottom price. You know your customer is a price buyer. 
	As you drive to your customer’s office, you get tied up in a huge traffic jam. You call your client from your car phone and ask her secretary if it would be okay to come about 30 minutes later than scheduled. He tells you not to worry. 
	As you are ushered into the buyer’s office, you greet your customer with a smile, ready to announce the good news. She informs you that she signed a contract with your competitor just ten minutes ago. Upon your insistence, she shows you the bottom line on the signed contract. You realize that by purchasing your system, she could have saved as much as $12,000. What do you do?

A.	Compare the two offers for the buyer, and ask her to cancel the signed contract.
B.	Tell her about your proposal, but do not suggest she cancel the signed contract.
C.	Say nothing. Keep your cool – act professionally. Otherwise, you will lose the customer forever. Accept the loss in a gracious and courteous manner.

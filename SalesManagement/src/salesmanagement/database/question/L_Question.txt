This is a cold call on the warehouse manager for Coat’s Western Wear, a retailer with four stores. You know most of the manager’s work consists of deliveries from the warehouse to the four stores. Based on your past experience, you suspect that the volume of shipments to the warehouse fluctuates, with certain seasons of the year being extremely busy.
	As a salesperson for the Hercules Shelving, you want to sell the manager your heavy-duty gauge steel shelving for use in the warehouse. Since this is a relatively small sale, you decide to go in cold, relying only on your questioning ability to uncover potential problems and make the prospect aware of them.
	You are now fact-to-face with the warehouse manager. You have introduced yourself and after some small talk you feel it is time to begin your approach. Which of the following question would serve your purpose best?

A.	Have you had any recent storage problems?
B.	How do you take care of your extra storage need during your busy seasons such as Christmas?
C.	Can you tell me a little about your storage problems?

This is your fourth call on Ace Building Supplies to get them to begin carrying and selling your home building supplies to local builders. Joe Newland, the buyer, has given you every indication the he likes your products. 
	During the call, Joe reaffirms his liking for your products and attempts to end the interview by standing up and saying “We’ll be ready to do business with you in three months – right after this slow season ends. Stop by then and we’ll definitely place an order with you.”
	Under these circumstances, which one of the following would you do? Why?

A.	Call back in three months to get the order as suggested.
B.	Try to get a firm commitment or order now.
C.	Telephone Joe in a month (rather than make a personal visit) and try to get the order.

You have just learned that one of your customers, Tom’s Discount Store, has received a shipment of faulty goods from your warehouse. The total cost of the merchandise is $2,500. Your company has a returned-goods policy that will only allow you to return $500 worth of your product at one time unless a reciprocal order is placed. What would you do?

A.	Call Tom’s and tell them you will be out to inspect the shipment in a couple of days.
B.	Ask Tom’s to patch up what they can and sell it at a reduced cost in an upcoming clearance sale.
C.	Send the merchandise back to your warehouse and credit Tom’s account for the price of the damaged goods.
D.	Get over to Tom’s as soon as possible that day, check the shipment to see if there are any undamaged goods that can be put on the shelf, get a replacement order from Tom’s manager, and phone in the order immediately. 
E.	Call your regional sales manager and ask what to do.

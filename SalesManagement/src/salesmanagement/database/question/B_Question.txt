Sam Gillespie, owner of Central Hardware Supply, was referred to you by a mutual friend. Gillepsie had been thinking of dropping two of their product suppliers of home building supplies. “The sales should be guaranteed,” your friend has stated. 
	Your friend’s information was correct and your presentation to Gillespie convinces you he will benefit from buying from you. He comments as you conclude your presentation: “Looks like your product will solve our problem. I’d like to think this over, however. Could you call me tomorrow or the next day?” The best way to handle this would be to:

A.	Follow his suggestion.
B.	Ignore his request and try a second close.
C.	Probe further. You might ask: “The fact that you have to think this over suggests that I haven’t convinced you. Is there something I’ve omitted or failed to satisfy you with?”

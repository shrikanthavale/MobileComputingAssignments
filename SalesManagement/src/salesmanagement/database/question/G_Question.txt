In this dual capacity she is often so rushed that she is normally impatient with salespeople. She is known for her habit of quickly turning down the salesperson, and shutting off the discussion by turning and walking away. In looking over Ms. Thompson’s operation, you notice that the inefficient metal shelving she is using in her warehouse is starting collapse. Warehouse employees have attempted to remedy the situation by building wooden shelves and reinforcing the weakened metal shelves with lumber. They have also begun stacking boxes on the floor requiring much more space.

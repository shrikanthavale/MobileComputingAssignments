In order to convince your customers that your product’s benefits are important, you must show how your product’s benefits will meet their needs. 
	Suppose your customer says: “I need some kind of gadget that will get me out of bed in the morning.” Check the statement below which best relates your product feature, the G.E. clock radio’s snooze alarm, to this customer’s need:

A.	“Ms. Jones, this G.E. radio has a snooze alarm which is very easy to operate. See, all you do is set this button and off it goes…”
B.	“Ms. Jones, the G.E. radio is the newest radio on the market. It carries a one-year guarantee and you can trade in your present radio and receive a substantial cut in the price.”
C.	“Ms. Jones, since you say you have trouble getting up in the morning, you want an alarm system that will make sure you wake up. Now, G.E.’s snooze alarm will wake you up no matter how often you shut the alarm off. You see, the alarm goes off every seven minutes until you switch off the “early bird knob.”

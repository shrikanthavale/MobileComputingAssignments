You work for the Lanier Pager Equipment Corporation selling pagers and other equipment. Imagine yourself as just entering the lobby and reception room of a small manufacturing company. You hand the receptionist your business card and ask to see the purchasing agent. “What is this in reference to?” the secretary asks, as two other salespeople approach. Which of the following alternatives would you use and why?

A.	Give a quick explanation of your equipment, ask whether the secretary has heard of your company, or used your equipment, and again ask to see the purchasing agent. 
B.	“I would like to discuss or paging equipment.”
C.	“I sell paging equipment designed to save your company money and provide greater efficiency. Companies like yours really like our products. Could you help me get in to see your purchasing agent?”
D.	Give a complete presentation and demonstration.

You are planning a call back on Mr. Pride and the president of his company to sell them several of your electric carts. The company’s manufacturing plant covers some 200 acres and you have sold many companies smaller than this one up to 10 carts. Since Mr. Pride is allowing you to meet with his company’s president and maybe other executives, you know he is interested in your carts. 
	You are determined to make a spellbinding presentation of your product’s benefits which will make use of visual aids and a demonstration of the cart itself. Mr. Pride raised several objections on you last presentation which may be brought up again by other executives. Your challenge is to develop a dramatic, convincing presentation. You plan to give a “live” demonstration of the cart to show how effective it is to move around the plant. Which of the following is the best technique for the demonstration?

A.	Get Mr. Pride and the president involved by letting them drive the cart. 
B.	You drive letting them ride so they will listen more carefully to you. 
C.	Leave a demonstrator and check back the next week to see how man they will buy.

Skaggs Omega, a large chain of supermarkets, has mailed you an inquiry on hardware items. They specifically wanted to know about your hammers, screwdrivers, and nails. Upon your arrival, you make your presentation to the purchasing agent, Linda Johnson. You start out by stating that you had visited several of their stores. You discuss your revolving retail display which contains an assortment of the three items Johnson had mentioned in her inquiry and relate the displays and advantages and features to benefits for Skaggs. 
	During your presentation, Johnson has listened but has said very little and has not given you any buying signals. However, it does appear she is interested. She did not object to your price nor did she raise any other objections.
	You are approaching the end of your presentation, and it is time to close. Actually you have said everything you can think of. What is the best way to ask Johnson for the order?

A.	“How do you like our products, Ms. Johnson?”
B.	“What assortment do you prefer, the A or B assortment?”
C.	“Can we go ahead with the order?”
